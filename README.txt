"# Raceline" 
How to use it:
Put in the number of creatures per generation
Put in the "generation step"
Enter 'Y' to resume with one generation step
Enter 'GO' to resume with 50 generation steps
Enter 'Save' to save the current generation

You can edit it (removing the comments needed comments) to make sure the best creature gets plotted with matplotlib.pyplot
Enter 'Plot' to plot it.

You can use the save generations to have a starting generation, benefitting the progress. 
To do so you should change the code of 'first_generation' and how the change of 'next_generation' by the 'zero_creature'
